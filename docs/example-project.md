# Example Project

The example project contains various examples of different cable setups using Tether.

[All versions of the project are available here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gpfCcJXPjYdn_gtNHK05VwFsNB2UIGG6)

In general you should use the example project that is the same version as the plugin, or if there if that doesn't exist, the next lowest.
For example if you had plugin version *1.2.1*, there is no example project with that exact version so the correct example project to use would be *1.2*.
