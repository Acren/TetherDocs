# Unreal Engine 5

Unreal Engine 5 is now officially supported in the Marketplace.

View releases on the [versions page](/info/versions).

:::note
UE5 changes the physics engine from PhysX to Chaos. The plugin mostly still works as expected, however the "self-collision" feature does not work with Chaos yet and is therefore disabled in this release.
It may also be more difficult to get cables to rest on other cables with the default settings - if so you can increase the Collision Friction in the Simulation Properties.
